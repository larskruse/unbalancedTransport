  abstract    = {This study examines the time complexities of the unbalanced optimal transport problems from an algorithmic perspective for the first time. We reveal which problems in unbalanced optimal transport can/cannot be solved efficiently. Specifically, we prove that the Kantorovich Rubinstein distance and optimal partial transport in the Euclidean metric cannot be computed in strongly subquadratic time under the strong exponential time hypothesis. Then, we propose an algorithm that solves a more general unbalanced optimal transport problem exactly in quasi-linear time on a tree metric. The proposed algorithm processes a tree with one million nodes in less than one second. Our analysis forms a foundation for the theoretical study of unbalanced optimal transport algorithms and opens the door to the applications of unbalanced optimal transport to million-scale datasets.},

  abstract    = {This article introduces a new class of fast algorithms to approximate variational problems involving unbalanced optimal transport. While classical optimal transport considers only normalized probability distributions, it is important for many applications to be able to compute some sort of relaxed transportation between arbitrary positive measures. A generic class of such "unbalanced" optimal transport problems has been recently proposed by several authors. In this paper, we show how to extend the, now classical, entropic regularization scheme to these unbalanced problems. This gives rise to fast, highly parallelizable algorithms that operate by performing only diagonal scaling (i.e. pointwise multiplications) of the transportation couplings. They are generalizations of the celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm. We show how these methods can be used to solve unbalanced transport, unbalanced gradient flows, and to compute unbalanced barycenters. We showcase applications to 2-D shape modification, color transfer, and growth models.},

  journal     = {arXiv:1412.5154},
  year        = {2014},
  abstract    = {This article details a general numerical framework to approximate so-lutions to linear programs related to optimal transport. The general idea is to introduce an entropic regularization of the initial linear program. This regularized problem corresponds to a Kullback-Leibler Bregman di-vergence projection of a vector (representing some initial joint distribu-tion) on the polytope of constraints. We show that for many problems related to optimal transport, the set of linear constraints can be split in an intersection of a few simple constraints, for which the projections can be computed in closed form. This allows us to make use of iterative Bregman projections (when there are only equality constraints) or more generally Bregman-Dykstra iterations (when inequality constraints are in-volved). We illustrate the usefulness of this approach to several variational problems related to optimal transport: barycenters for the optimal trans-port metric, tomographic reconstruction, multi-marginal optimal trans-port and in particular its application to Brenier's relaxed solutions of in-compressible Euler equations, partial un-balanced optimal transport and optimal transport with capacity constraints.},

  year        = {2016},
  abstract    = {Scaling algorithms for entropic transport-type problems have become a very popular numerical method, encompassing Wasserstein barycenters, multi-marginal problems, gradient flows and unbalanced transport. However, a standard implementation of the scaling algorithm has several numerical limitations: the scaling factors diverge and convergence becomes impractically slow as the entropy regularization approaches zero. Moreover, handling the dense kernel matrix becomes unfeasible for large problems. To address this, we combine several modifications: A log-domain stabilized formulation, the well-known epsilon-scaling heuristic, an adaptive truncation of the kernel and a coarse-to-fine scheme. This permits the solution of larger problems with smaller regularization and negligible truncation error. A new convergence analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm is developed, working towards a better understanding of epsilon-scaling. Numerical examples illustrate efficiency and versatility of the modified algorithm.},

This raises the necessity for fast nearest neighbor search algorithms according to this distance, which poses a substantial computational bottleneck on massive datasets. In this work we introduce Flowtree, a fast and accurate approximation algorithm for the Wasserstein-$1$ distance. We formally analyze its approximation factor and running time. We perform extensive experimental evaluation of nearest neighbor search algorithms in the $W_1$ distance on real-world dataset. Our results show that compared to previous state of the art, Flowtree achieves up to $7.4$ times faster running time.},

  abstract      = {Optimal transport induces the Earth Mover's (Wasserstein) distance between probability distributions, a geometric divergence that is relevant to a wide range of problems. Over the last decade, two relaxations of optimal transport have been studied in depth: unbalanced transport, which is robust to the presence of outliers and can be used when distributions don't have the same total mass; entropy-regularized transport, which is robust to sampling noise and lends itself to fast computations using the Sinkhorn algorithm. This paper combines both lines of work to put robust optimal transport on solid ground. Our main contribution is a generalization of the Sinkhorn algorithm to unbalanced transport: our method alternates between the standard Sinkhorn updates and the pointwise application of a contractive function. This implies that entropic transport solvers on grid images, point clouds and sampled distributions can all be modified easily to support unbalanced transport, with a proof of linear convergence that holds in all settings. We then show how to use this method to define pseudo-distances on the full space of positive measures that satisfy key geometric axioms: (unbalanced) Sinkhorn divergences are differentiable, positive, definite, convex, statistically robust and avoid any "entropic bias" towards a shrinkage of the measures' supports.},
