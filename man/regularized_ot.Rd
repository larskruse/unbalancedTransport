\arguments{
\item{supplyList}{A list containing the information about the supply distribution, 
divergence function and parameter. The first element is the supply distribution itself,
the second the abbreviation of the divergence function ("KL" for Kullback Leibner, 
"TV" for total variation, "RG" for range constraint, "Power", "Berg" and "Hellinger") followed by the parameters 
needed for the divergence function: 

In case of the KL divergence (\eqn{F_1 = \lambda \cdot KL()}{F1 = lambda * KL()}),
TV divergence (\eqn{F_1 = \lambda \cdot TV()}{F1 = lambda * TV()}) and all Power
divergences (\eqn{F_1 = \lambda \cdot Power()}{F1 = lambda * Power()}) the
regularization parameter \eqn{\lambda}{lambda} has to be provided.

The "Power" divergence also needs the conjugate exponent as second parameter.

The divergence function associated with the range constraint needs two parameters which define the upper and 
lower bounds. 


If the cost matrix is not provided, the support of the supply and demand distributions has to be provided as last element in the list. This can
be omitted if a cost matrix is passed as argument.}

\item{demandList}{A list containing the information about the demand measure in the same form as the supplyList.}

\item{eps}{A numeric value for the regularization parameter.}

\item{iterMax}{(optional) The maximum number of algorithm iterations. The default value is 5000}

\item{tol}{(optional) A numeric value. If the change of the dual variables from one step to the next is smaller than this value. The algorithm
is terminated as it is already converged. The default value is 1e-5.}

\item{method}{(optional) Determines the method that is used to compute the cost matrix:
\itemize{
\item "euclidean"
\item "minkowski"
\item "maximum" 
}
The default value is "euclidean".}

\item{exp}{(optional) The exponent that is applied to the cost matrix. Can be used to compute quadratic cost. The default value is 1.}

\item{p}{(optional) Parameter for the minkwski cost function. Can be omitted if either "euclidean" or "maximum" is used. The default value is 2.}

\item{wfr}{(optional) Computes the cost matrix needed for the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao distance \eqn{c(x,y) = -\log(\cos^2_+(d(x,y)))}{c(x,y) = -log(cos_+(d(x,y)Â²))}.
The default value is "false".}

\item{Cxy}{(optional) A cost matrix for transport between the supply and demand distributions.}

\description{
Calculating the regularized transport cost.
}
\details{
This function calculates the regularized optimal transport costs using the \code{\link[unbalancedTransport]{sinkhornAlgorithm}}.
The regularized transport cost is defined as \eqn{OT_\varepsilon = sup_{f,g} -<\alpha, \phi^*(-f)> - 
<\beta, \phi^*(-g)> - \varepilon <\alpha \times \beta , \exp{(f+g-C)/\varepsilon}- 1>}

with supply and demand distributions \eqn{\alpha}{a} and \eqn{\beta}{b}, optimal dual potentials \eqn{f} and \eqn{g}, 
Legendre transforms of the divergence function \eqn{\phi^*}, cost matrix \eqn{C} and regularization parameter \eqn{\varepsilon}{eps}.
