\usage{
BalancedExtensionSolver(
  supplyList,
  demandList,
  p = 1,
  q = 2,
  wfr = FALSE,
  costMatrix = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{supplyList}{A list containing the information about the supply. The first element hast to be the distribution followed by
 a vector specifying the cost for destruction of mass at each supply point. If no cost matrix is provided, the third element has to be 
the positions of the supply points. This can either be a vector or a matrix where each row gives the coordinates for one point.}

\item{demandList}{A list similar to the supplyList but holding the information about the demand.}

\item{p}{(optional) The exponent that is applied to the cost matrix. Can
be used to compute quadratic cost. The default value is 1.}

\item{q}{(optional) Parameter for the minkwski cost function. Can be omitted
if either "euclidean" or "maximum" is used. The default value is 2.}

\item{wfr}{(optional) Computes the cost matrix needed for the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao
 distance \eqn{c(x,y) = -\log(\cos^2_+(d(x,y)))}{c(x,y) = -log(cos_+(d(x,y)Â²))}.
The default value is "false".}

\item{costMatrix}{(optional) Instead of having the algorithm compute the
cost matrix, a custom cost matrix can be passed to the algorithm.}

Solving unbalanced optimal transport problems by extending them to a balanced

\details{
This function solves unbalanced optimal transport problems by extending them
to a balanced problem and applying the revised simplex algorithm.
The unbalanced optimal transport problem \eqn{<C,r> + \sum_i p_i(\alpha_i - \sum_j r_{ij}) + \sum_j q_j(\beta-\sum_i r{ij})}{
<C,r> + sum_i(p_i (a_i-sum_j r_ij)) + sum_j(q_j (b_j-sum_i r_ij))} with supply
and demand measure \eqn{\alpha}{a} and \eqn{\beta}{b}, cost matrix C, 
transport plan \eqn{r} and construction and destruction costs \eqn{p} and 
\eqn{q} is transformed to a balanced transport problem by extending the cost
 matrix as well as supply and demand vectors. 

The resulting transport problem is then solved using the reverse simplex algorithm provided by the \code{\link[transport]{transport}} package.

If the cost matrix fulfils the Monge property, a algorithm designed take advantage of this special structure can be used as well. However, the 
Monge algorithm is not as efficient as the revised simplex algorithm.
