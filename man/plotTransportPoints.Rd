\title{Plotting transport between single points.}
\usage{
plotTransportPoints(transportPlan, supplyList, demandList)
}
\arguments{
\item{transportPlan}{A non negative numeric matrix that indicates where the mass is
transported. The value at point \eqn{\[i,j\]} is the amount of mass transported from
supply point \eqn{i} to demand point \eqn{j}.}

\item{supplyList}{A list containing the information about the supply measure. The first element hast to be the mass
distribution followed by
a vector specifying the cost for destruction of mass at each supply point. Lastly, the positions of the supply points. 
Has to be provided. This can either be a vector or a matrix where each row gives the coordinates for one point.}

\item{demandList}{A list similar to the supplyList but holding the information about the demand distribution.
