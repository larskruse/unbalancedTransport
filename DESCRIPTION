Description: This package provides functions to solve and plot the solutions of
    unbalanced optimal transport problems. These include iterative methods for
    regularized transport, a function to solve transport on tree metrics and a solver
    that extends a given unbalanced transport problem to a balanced Kantorovich problem and applies the 
    well known networkflow algorithm.
    Additionally, functions to plot the results and example distributions are provided.
